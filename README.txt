As a result of the parsing error when running ewl.txt, 1 incorrectly spelled word "ve" had been discovered.

New abstract void method sortArray() has been created, located at Line 62 in EwlStructureAdapator.java
New method void sortArray() has been created, located at line 32-34 in EwlListAdaptor.java
