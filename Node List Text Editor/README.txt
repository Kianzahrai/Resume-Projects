Designed and developed a simple Text Editor in Node List structures:

1. Enter textual information into the Text Editor
2. Undo actions performed
3. Open pre-written text files
4. Invoke a spell check operation to verify the correctness of the words in the text document

For more information, refer to the Instructions.pdf file.
For practice, part 1 of the repository introduces some necessary concpets for the completeion of part 2.

Runtimes:
ewl.txt: 30ms
TCP_RFC.txt: 8ms

As a result of the parsing error when running ewl.txt, 1 incorrectly spelled word "ve" had been discovered.
Implementation of sortArray is required, because the incorrectly parsed word "we've" split into "we" and "ve" objectifies the sorted array.
New abstract void method sortArray() has been created, located at Line 62 in EwlStructureAdapator.java
New method void sortArray() has been created, located at line 32-34 in EwlListAdaptor.java
